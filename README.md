# Demonstration of Babylonjs app built with react 
## This app runs using WebGPU 
WebGPU is the soon to be the new standard for web-based graphic applications

If your browser or GPU is incompatible, the app will fallback to WebGL 

> WebGPU is an API that exposes the capabilities of GPU hardware for the Web. The API is designed from the ground up to efficiently map to (post-2014) native GPU APIs. WebGPU is not related to WebGL and does not explicitly target OpenGL ES.
